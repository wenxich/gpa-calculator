# Student Essentials

A student essentials website for UPenn students created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features a semester **GPA calculator** and a **to-do list** you can update and save (currently also working on a **Pomodoro timer**).

You can view the site <a href="https://essentials.neocities.org">here</a>.

<i>NOTE: If you are using this site as a template for your own site, I would be very glad if you add a link to the original site with my name in footer.</i>
