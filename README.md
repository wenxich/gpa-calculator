# Student Essentials

A student essentials website for UPenn students created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features a semester **GPA calculator** and a **to-do list** you can update and save (currently also working on a **Pomodoro timer**).

You can view the site <a href="https://essentials.neocities.org">here</a>.

<i>NOTE: If you are using this site as a template for your own site, I would be very glad if you add a link to the original site with my name in footer.</i>

<b>Upcoming features:</b>
<li><i>GPA Calculator:</i> Make letter grades an option in the table, so that users don't have to convert the grades themselves</li>
<li><i>To-Do List:</i> Make a markdown preview feature</li>
<li><i>Study TImer:</i> Make sound play when the timer ends
